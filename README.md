WalmartSearchAPI
Following steps are followed while designing walmart product search algorithm

1.)Search for the product depending upton the input string given by the user using walmart search api.

2.)Using the first result product id search for the product recommendations using Walmart's Product Recommendation API. Assumption: If first result product id doesnt find return any recommendations then algorithm would search for 2nd result product till 10th result product id and if still no recommendations are found then return empty result.

3.) After returning recommendations for each recommended product we get the reviews.

4.) We can understand the semantics the reviews by considering review stars and number and difference between upvotes and downvotes.

5.) Depending on maximum number of reviews and maximum number of upvotes -downvotes we can sort the products and return the products to the user with better review stars and good number of upvotes in comparison with downvotes. 6.) Assumptions: If no recommendations of product are available then just return the product list to the user.
